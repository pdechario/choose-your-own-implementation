# choose-your-own-implementation — Design Spec

**Purpose:** This document is the source of truth for the architecture and requirements of the tool. It describes what the tool should do, how it should work, and what remains to be implemented. Use this when you need to understand the design decisions, workflow steps, or integration points.

**Note:** For implementation notes about completed work, decisions made during S1+, and how prior stories affect future files, see [STORY_CONTEXT.md](STORY_CONTEXT.md).

A Python CLI tool (using the Anthropic SDK directly) that guides software development through a structured, spec-driven workflow. Covers new feature development and bug fixes. Exposes 7 steps, each representing a phase. State persists in JSON files so work survives session restarts. The UX is choose-your-own-adventure style — at each decision point the tool presents branching options rather than a rigid linear pipeline. Intended to be open-sourced.

Claude Code integration (slash commands) is an optional layer on top — the core tool runs standalone from any terminal.

---

## How It Works

`workflow.py` is the entrypoint — a Click-based Python CLI that calls the Anthropic SDK directly. It manages state, selects the model per step, builds the prompt (injecting only the fields needed from prior steps), calls `anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(...)`, and writes output JSON. No Claude Code dependency required.

Tools needed by each step (file reads, bash commands, git diff) are implemented as Anthropic SDK tool definitions — Python handles the tool call loop itself (currently in `workflow.py`; scheduled to move to a dedicated module in S2.2).

```
terminal
    $ python workflow.py step context
    ↓ Anthropic SDK (model: Haiku) + custom tools
    ↓ writes .claude/workflow/context.json
    → displays output, prompts user approval / feedback loop

    $ python workflow.py step spec
    ↓ reads context.json (selective fields only)
    ↓ Anthropic SDK (model: Sonnet)
    ↓ writes spec.json
    ...and so on
```

Claude Code integration is optional: a `plugin.yaml` can register these as slash commands so users can run `/design-context` from the IDE, but the Python CLI works without it.

## Workflow Navigation

Steps are a linked list: `context ↔ spec ↔ tests ↔ code ↔ run-tests ↔ review ↔ merge`

### Choose Your Own Adventure UX

The tool is not a rigid pipeline — at every decision point it presents numbered or lettered options and waits for the user to choose. This applies to:
- Which direction to go (next step, back to revise, skip)
- Which test suite to run in `run-tests`
- How to respond to test failures (fix code, re-run subset, skip and note)
- Whether to run optional substeps (e.g., e2e tests)

The goal is that running the workflow feels engaging and in-control, not like being pushed through a conveyor belt.

### Forward (normal)
After each step completes, the orchestrator presents options like:
```
What next?
  [1] Continue to → run-tests
  [2] Revise this step
  [3] Go back to spec
  [4] Exit and resume later
```

### Backward (revision)
Going back from step N to step M:
1. Mark step M as `in_progress`
2. Mark all steps after M as `pending` (invalidated — their JSON is stale)
3. User re-runs step M and approves the new output
4. Orchestrator presents choices: auto-re-run invalidated steps, or prompt before each

### Within-step iteration
Each step runs a refinement loop before writing JSON (implemented as a dedicated story within each step epic):
1. Claude produces candidate output
2. User reads it; can provide feedback ("narrow the scope to auth only")
3. Claude refines — same step, same model, prior attempt stays in context
4. Loop exits on user approval (`approve` / `done` / empty enter)
5. JSON is written only on approval

This pattern is consistent across all 7 steps; each step epic includes a dedicated story for the iteration implementation.

### Decision Tree: `run-tests`
`run-tests` has its own internal branching — it is not a simple pass/fail:

```
run-tests
├── Choose suite:
│   [1] Unit only (fast)
│   [2] Unit + integration
│   [3] Full suite (includes e2e) ← optional, prompted separately
│   [4] Custom: pick specific test files
│
└── After results:
    ├── All pass → suggest review
    ├── Some fail →
    │   [1] Go back to code step to fix
    │   [2] Re-run only the failing tests
    │   [3] Skip and note failures in review.json
    └── E2e only → separate prompt: "Run e2e tests now? (slow, ~Xm)" [y/N]
```

---

## The 7 Steps

Steps are invoked as `python workflow.py step <name>`. The `/design-*` names are the user-facing aliases (also used as Claude Code slash commands if `plugin.yaml` is installed).

### 1. `context` (`/design-context`)
**Purpose:** Understand the problem space before any design decisions.

**Inputs (user provides at invocation):**
- Brief description of what they want to build or fix
- Optionally: GitHub epic/story reference (e.g. `Epic 6 / S6.2`) — links this run to a tracked story in `KANBAN.md`

**Claude tasks:**
- Explore the codebase to find affected files, services, utilities
- Identify what must NOT be broken (blast radius)
- Surface ambiguities and open questions
- Propose 2–3 high-level prototype options with tradeoffs

**Output schema — `context.json`:**
```json
{
  "problem_statement": "string",
  "affected_files": ["path/to/file.py"],
  "connected_services": ["ServiceName"],
  "constraints": ["must not break existing session tokens"],
  "open_questions": ["should we support OAuth?"],
  "prototype_options": [
    {
      "name": "Option A",
      "summary": "string",
      "tradeoffs": "string"
    }
  ],
  "github_reference": { "epic": 6, "story": "S6.2" },
  "step_status": "complete",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

`github_reference` is `null` if no GitHub reference was provided at invocation.

**Model:** `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` — fast and cheap for codebase exploration

**Verify (S3.5):**
- `python workflow.py step context` produces valid `context.json` on a real small feature
- Iteration loop works: give feedback mid-step, confirm Claude refines without writing JSON until approved

---

### 2. `spec` (`/design-spec`)
**Purpose:** Make explicit design decisions based on the gathered context.

**Reads from:** `context.json` (fields: `problem_statement`, `open_questions`, `prototype_options`, `constraints`)

**Claude tasks:**
- Resolve the open questions from context
- Select one prototype option with justification
- Define data models, API contracts, interfaces
- Note edge cases that must be handled
- Call out anything deferred to a future iteration

**Output schema — `spec.json`:**
```json
{
  "chosen_approach": "Option A",
  "rationale": "string",
  "data_models": {},
  "api_contracts": ["POST /api/foo → { bar: string }"],
  "edge_cases": ["empty payload", "concurrent writes"],
  "out_of_scope": ["pagination"],
  "open_items": [],
  "step_status": "complete",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

**Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6` — complex reasoning required

**Verify (S4.5):**
- `spec.json` resolves open questions from `context.json`; chosen approach and rationale are present
- Iteration loop works: provide feedback mid-step, confirm Claude refines without writing JSON until approved

---

### 3. `tests` (`/design-tests`)
**Purpose:** Define the test strategy before implementation begins.

**Reads from:** `context.json` + `spec.json` (selective fields)

**Claude tasks:**
- Identify testing levels needed (unit / integration / e2e)
- Generate concrete test case descriptions for happy path and all edge cases from spec
- Flag dependencies that need mocking vs real implementation
- Note what is hard to test and why

**Output schema — `tests.json`:**
```json
{
  "unit_tests": [
    {
      "name": "returns 401 for missing token",
      "target": "src/auth/login.py",
      "notes": "string"
    }
  ],
  "integration_tests": [],
  "e2e_tests": [],
  "mocking_required": ["EmailService"],
  "hard_to_test": ["race condition in session expiry — needs mock clock"],
  "step_status": "complete",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

**Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6`

**Verify (S5.6):**
- `tests.json` covers all edge cases listed in `spec.json`
- Test files exist on disk and fail (red) before `code` step runs
- Iteration loop works: provide feedback mid-step, confirm Claude refines without writing JSON until approved

---

### 4. `code` (`/design-code`)
**Purpose:** Define the implementation plan — which files to touch, what to write, how to structure it.

**Reads from:** `context.json` + `spec.json` (NOT `tests.json` — implementation is derived from the design, not the test strategy)

**Claude tasks:**
- Break the spec down into concrete implementation tasks
- For each task: identify which file(s) to modify or create, what functions/classes/methods to add
- Define function signatures and module interfaces
- Note any new dependencies to add
- Flag anything in the spec that is ambiguous from an implementation standpoint

**Output schema — `code.json`:**
```json
{
  "implementation_tasks": [
    {
      "description": "Add OAuth token validation middleware",
      "files": ["src/auth/middleware.py"],
      "functions": ["validate_oauth_token(token: str) -> User"],
      "notes": "string"
    }
  ],
  "new_dependencies": ["authlib==1.2.1"],
  "implementation_questions": ["Should token refresh be handled here or in the client?"],
  "step_status": "complete",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

**Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6` — requires reasoning about the codebase structure and spec requirements together

**Verify (S6.6):**
- `code.json` implementation tasks map directly to spec's API contracts
- Written code makes the test suite go green
- Iteration loop works: provide feedback mid-step, confirm Claude refines without writing JSON until approved

---

### 5. `run-tests` (`/run-tests`)
**Purpose:** Execute the test suite and handle failures before committing.

**Reads from:** `tests.json` — the design-tests spec is the source of truth for correctness. Claude uses it to cross-reference actual results against what was designed: are the tests that were supposed to exist actually present? Are the edge cases from the spec covered? Does a failure indicate a bug in the implementation or a gap in the test design itself?

Does NOT read `code.json` — code quality is assessed by running the tests, not by the implementation plan.

**User chooses at runtime:**
- Which suite to run: unit / unit + integration / full (with e2e) / custom
- E2e tests are prompted separately ("Run e2e? ~Xm [y/N]") — not included by default
- On failure: fix code (loop back to `code` step), re-run subset, or skip with a noted reason

**Claude tasks:**
- Execute the chosen test suite via `run_bash` tool
- Parse test output to extract pass/fail counts, failure messages, and tracebacks
- Cross-reference results against `tests.json`: flag any designed test cases that are missing or untested
- Summarize failures in plain language, noting whether each failure is a code bug or a test design gap
- Record which suites were run and their results

**Output schema — `run_tests.json`:**
```json
{
  "suites_run": ["unit", "integration"],
  "e2e_run": false,
  "results": {
    "unit": {"passed": 42, "failed": 2, "skipped": 1},
    "integration": {"passed": 8, "failed": 0, "skipped": 0}
  },
  "failures": [
    {
      "test": "test_validate_token_expired",
      "file": "tests/auth/test_login.py",
      "message": "AssertionError: expected 401, got 200",
      "suggested_fix": "Token expiry check is missing in validate_oauth_token"
    }
  ],
  "overall_status": "partial_failure | pass | fail",
  "skipped_reason": "null | string (if user chose to skip failures)",
  "step_status": "complete",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

**Model:** `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` — mechanical test execution and output parsing; escalates to Sonnet if failures need diagnostic reasoning

**Verify (S7.7):**
- Run unit tests on a real project; confirm `run_tests.json` captures pass/fail counts and failures
- Simulate a failure; confirm all three branching options (back to code, re-run subset, skip) appear and work
- Iteration loop works: provide feedback on test results, confirm Claude refines without writing JSON until approved

---

### 6. `review` (`/review-iterate-commit`)
**Purpose:** Pre-commit review — catch regressions, version issues, linting issues; draft the commit.

**Reads from:** `spec.json` + `tests.json` + `code.json` + `run_tests.json` + live `git diff`

**Claude tasks:**
- Run linting (via `run_bash` tool definition)
- Review the diff against the spec (did we implement what we designed?)
- Check for version upgrade concerns (dep bumps, breaking API changes)
- Draft a commit message
- List any blockers that should prevent commit

**Output schema — `review.json`:**
```json
{
  "linting_status": "pass | fail",
  "linting_issues": [],
  "spec_adherence": "full | partial | diverged",
  "divergences": ["added extra param not in spec: reason X"],
  "version_concerns": ["upgraded pydantic 1→2: validators are breaking"],
  "blockers": [],
  "commit_message": "feat: add OAuth login support\n\nLong description...",
  "step_status": "complete",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

**Model:** `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for mechanical checks; auto-escalate to `claude-sonnet-4-6` if divergences or blockers are found

**Verify (S8.6):**
- Linting runs; diff is reviewed against spec; commit message is drafted; blockers list is present
- No uncommitted linting fixes remain
- Iteration loop works: provide feedback mid-step, confirm Claude refines without writing JSON until approved

---

### 7. `merge` (`/merge`)
**Purpose:** Wrap up — update changelog, docs, Claude context; verify nothing was left behind.

**Reads from:** all prior JSON files

**Claude tasks:**
- Write or append a `CHANGELOG.md` entry
- Update relevant documentation files
- Add/update a `CLAUDE.md` section describing what this change does and where to find it
- Scan for stale TODOs or commented-out code
- Draft PR description
- If `context.json` has a `github_reference`, update `KANBAN.md` — set that story's status to `done`

**Output schema — `merge.json`:**
```json
{
  "changelog_entry": "### vX.Y.Z\n- Added OAuth login...",
  "docs_updated": ["docs/auth.md"],
  "claude_md_section": "string",
  "stale_todos": [],
  "pr_description_draft": "string",
  "kanban_updated": true,
  "kanban_story_closed": "S6.2",
  "step_status": "complete",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601"
}
```

**Model:** `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`

**Verify (S9.6):**
- `merge.json` contains coherent changelog entry and PR description draft
- Stale TODO scan runs; written files match the merge plan
- Iteration loop works: provide feedback mid-step, confirm Claude refines without writing JSON until approved

---

## GitHub Integration

The tool optionally links each workflow run to a specific story in `KANBAN.md`, creating a closed loop between doing the work and tracking it.

### How the loop works

```
1. User invokes `context` step with a GitHub reference (e.g. "Epic 6 / S6.2")
2. Reference is stored in context.json and flows through all subsequent steps
3. merge step reads context.json → updates KANBAN.md, setting S6.2 status to "done"
4. KANBAN.md commit triggers the sync-kanban GHA workflow
5. GHA calls Claude Haiku → regenerates issue body → patches GitHub Issue #6 (checkbox checked)
6. When all stories in an epic are done → issue auto-closes
```

### Reference is optional

If no GitHub reference is provided at invocation, `github_reference` is `null` in `context.json` and the `merge` step skips the KANBAN.md update. The tool works fully without GitHub.

### GHA sync script

`.github/workflows/sync-kanban.yml` triggers on pushes to `main` that touch `KANBAN.md`. It runs `.github/scripts/sync_kanban.py`, which:
1. Regex-parses `KANBAN.md` using the data structure contract defined in `KANBAN.md`
2. Fetches current `epic`-labelled GitHub Issues
3. Calls Claude Haiku to generate updated issue bodies from the parsed epic data
4. Patches each issue via the GitHub API; closes issues where all stories are `done`

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to be set as a repo secret.

---

## Token Efficiency

| Technique | How |
|-----------|-----|
| Selective injection | Each step reads only the fields it needs from prior JSONs, not the full file |
| Prompt caching | System prompts (step instructions, style guides) use `cache_control` header — stable across iterations |
| Model tiering | Haiku for exploration/mechanical tasks, Sonnet for reasoning (see table below) |
| Summarization hook | If a prior JSON exceeds a token threshold, Python runs a Haiku summarization pass before injecting it |

### Model Tier Table

| Step | Model | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| context | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Fast codebase exploration |
| spec | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Complex design reasoning |
| tests | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Deep edge case coverage |
| code | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Reasoning about codebase structure and spec together |
| run-tests | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (default) | Mechanical test execution; escalates to Sonnet on failures |
| review | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (default) | Mechanical; escalates to Sonnet on divergence |
| merge | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Doc formatting |

## Open Questions

1. **Tool scope per step:** Which tools does each step need? All steps likely need `read_file` and `run_bash`. Only `context` needs broad file traversal; `review` needs `git_diff`. Define the minimal tool set per step to avoid unnecessary surface area. (Pending S2+)

2. **Distribution:** Install via `pip install -e .` from the plugin directory, or publish to PyPI? For open-source sharing, PyPI is better UX. For now, local editable install is fine. (Resolved in S1.1: using `pip install -e .`)

3. **API key:** Read `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from env var; fall back to `.env` in the project root. Document this clearly in setup instructions. (Pending S2+)

4. **Claude Code integration:** Verify how `plugin.yaml` should reference the CLI command so slash commands work correctly from the IDE. This is secondary — solve after the CLI works standalone. (Pending S10+)

5. **Click vs Typer:** S1.2 chose Click for dispatch. Do not switch to Typer without updating routing logic in S10.1–S10.3. (Resolved in S1.2)

---

## Implementation Progress

**Completed (S1):**
1. ✅ S1.1 — Set up `pyproject.toml` with `anthropic` and `click` as deps
2. ✅ S1.2 — Scaffold `workflow.py` with Click dispatch; tool call loop (temporary in workflow.py, moves to S2.2)
3. ✅ S1.3 — Implement `state.py` persistence layer (opaque JSON storage; backward navigation with status cascade)

**In Progress / Next (S2–S9):**
Each of the 7 step epics (S3–S9) follows the same pattern:
- S*.1 — Write system prompt (`prompts/*.md`)
- S*.2 — Implement step logic (reads prior state, calls Claude, writes output JSON)
- S*.3 — Implement within-step iteration loop (user feedback → refine → approve → write)
- S*.4/5 — Wire into routing; execute phase (if needed)
- S*.5/6 — Verify (including iteration loop testing)

**Next (S10+):**
10. Implement forward/backward navigation menus (S10.1–S10.2)
11. Re-run prompt for invalidated steps (S10.3)
12. Token optimization pass — selective field injection, prompt caching, summarization hook
13. Write setup docs — install instructions, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` config, optional Claude Code integration

---

## Verification

**Per-step verification (S3–S9):**
Each step's verify story includes iteration loop testing as part of the verification task. See the **Verify** subsection under each step above for specific criteria.

**Integration verification:**
- Run each step (context → spec → tests → code → run-tests → review → merge) in sequence on a real small feature
- At each step, test the iteration loop: provide feedback, confirm Claude refines without writing JSON until approved
- Navigate backward: from any step, go back to an earlier step, verify all downstream JSONs are marked `pending`
- Test CYOA navigation: confirm that after each step, the tool presents numbered choices and waits for user input
- Test run-tests branching: choose different suites, simulate failures, confirm branching options (back to code / re-run / skip)
- Cost verification: run a full workflow end-to-end, inspect Anthropic API logs for model tiers and cache hit rate
